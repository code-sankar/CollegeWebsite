              `It all begins with a small step. The Diocese of Dibrugarh had
              been on the hunt out for a plot of land from the year 1983 to
              establish a center of ours at Sivasagar. By the end of 1984, Rev.
              Fr. Alex Kapiarumala was entrusted with this task. Fr. Alex optly
              called the ‘Pioner Palter’ visited with various people and places
              in search of a suitable land in and around Sivasagar. Finally, Lt.
              Adv Mr. Anil Dutta directed Fr. Alex to Mr. Hemo Gogoi of
              Cherekapar, Who after a lot of negotiation decided to part with a
              portion of his land. This plot is situated by the B.G. Road, some
              3kms from the Sivasagar Town.

              establishing a English Medium School, and for other Church
              functions. The formal opening of the center was done in a public
